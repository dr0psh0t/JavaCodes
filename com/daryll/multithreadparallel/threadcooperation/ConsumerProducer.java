Suppose you use a buffer to store integers and that the buffer size is limited.
The buffer provides the method write(int) to add an int value to the buffer and the method read()
to read and delete an int value from the buffer. To synchronize the operations, use a lock
with two conditions: notEmpty (i.e., the buffer is not empty) and notFull (i.e., the buffer
is not full). When a task adds an int to the buffer, if the buffer is full, the task will wait for
the notFull condition. When a task reads an int from the buffer, if the buffer is empty, the
task will wait for the notEmpty condition. The interaction between the two tasks is shown in Figure 30.18.

Listing 30.7 presents the complete program. The program contains the Buffer class (lines
50–101) and two tasks for repeatedly adding and consuming numbers to and from the buffer
(lines 16–47). The write(int) method (lines 62–79) adds an integer to the buffer. The
read() method (lines 81–100) deletes and returns an integer from the buffer.

notEmpty.signal();--------+---+-notFull.signal();

The conditions notFull and notEmpty are used to coordinate task interactions.

The buffer is actually a first-in, first-out queue (lines 52–53). The conditions notEmpty
and notFull on the lock are created in lines 59–60. The conditions are bound to a lock. A
lock must be acquired before a condition can be applied. If you use the wait() and notify()
methods to rewrite this example, you have to designate two objects as monitors.
